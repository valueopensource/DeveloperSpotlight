# Developer Spotlight

This year @ FOSDEM 2020 the xs:code team is looking for developers who want to share the story behind their open source projects.
If you are interested and willing to interview on camera and share your story please contact elad@xscode.com for more details.

# What is Developer Spotlight
Developer spotlight is a new show that the xs:code team is producing, focusing on open source developers and their projects.
We are interested in hearing the stories behind your open source projects, why you have created them, how much time do you spend working and maintaining them.
What motivates you as a developer to create and maintain an open-source project.
The videos will be published in our YouTube channel.

# Where can you find us
This year we will be attending FOSDEM 2020.
Will update on the exact location on the conference once we arrive.
